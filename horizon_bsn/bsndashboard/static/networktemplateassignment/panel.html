<!--The table this panel uses is a modified variant of the hz-resource-table that is used in other panels. This is because -->
<!--the table behavior we require is not something easily implemented in the framework. To apply a network template, calls-->
<!--to Heat must be called. These calls return promises that resolve immediately, but do not signify the completion of the -->
<!--operation (these operations take longer) Instead, we must continually query Heat to check on the status of the call.-->
<!--Then, when the operation is complete, we continue the next steps. This is only easily done by modifying the-->
<!--controller of the table.-->
